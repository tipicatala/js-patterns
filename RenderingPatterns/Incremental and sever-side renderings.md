**Incremental Static Regeneration** - Pre-render certain pages, and render the other pages on-demand.
**SSR** - With Server-Side rendering, we can generate HTML on the server (or serverless function) on every request.
**Streaming SSr** - Streaming Server-Side rendering allows us to send components down to the client as soon as they've been generated.

With regular Server-Side rendering, the user has to wait for the entire HTML to be generated on the server before it gets send down to the client. Before hydration could begin, the entire bundle had to be downloaded and executed.
